## Success Criteria

| Name | Description | External References |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `acc256.1` | Are there text alternatives for information, which is conveyed through sensory characteristics such as color, shape, size, visual position and sound? Do these text alternatives serve the same purpose? | |
| `acc256.2` | Can this information only be distinguished by visual characteristics (color and shape/position)?  | |
| `acc256.3` | Do the instructions provided for understanding and operating content, rely on semantic references to objects, like labels, instead of relying solely on sensory characteristics of components (such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound)? | |
